# HCMV-TB40-E-GFP-reference-genome
HCMV reference genomes for IGV browser
These are reference genomes required for viewing BigWig files from Forte, et al, "Epigenetic reprogramming of host and viral genes by Human Cytomegalovirus infection in Kasumi-3 myeloid progenitor cells at early times post-infection" in the IGV viewer.
The reference genomes were created by adding GFP sequences to the TB40/E clone TB40-BAC4 (accession number EF999921.1).
Usage:
1. Go to the IGV viewer (http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download)
2. Click "Genomes->Load Genome from File" to load the HCMV reference genome (HCMV_GFP.fa).
3. Click "File->Load from File" to load the HCMV_GFP.gtf file.
4. Click "File->Load from File" to upload bigwig files.
