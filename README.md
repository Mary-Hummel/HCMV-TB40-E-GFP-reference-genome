# HCMV-TB40-E-GFP-reference-genome
These are HCMV reference genomes used for viewing BigWig files associated with the SuperSeries GSE164861 in the IGV viewer.
The reference genomes were created by adding GFP sequences to the TB40/E clone TB40-BAC4 (accession number EF999921.1).
Usage:
1. Go to the IGV viewer (downloaded at http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download)
2. Click "Genomes->Load Genome from File" to load the HCMV reference genome (HCMV_GFP.fa).
3. Click "File->Load from File" to load the HCMV_GFP.gtf file.
4. Click "File->Load from File" to load bigwig files from the series.
