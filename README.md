# HCMV-TB40-E-GFP-reference-genome
These are reference genomes used for viewing BigWig files from Forte, et al, "Epigenetic reprogramming of host and viral genes by Human Cytomegalovirus infection in Kasumi-3 myeloid progenitor cells at early times post-infection" in the IGV viewer.
The reference genomes were created by adding GFP sequences to the TB40/E clone TB40-BAC4 (accession number EF999921.1).
Usage:
1. Go to the IGV viewer (http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download)
2. Click "Genomes->Load Genome from File" to load the HCMV reference genome (HCMV_GFP.fa).
3. Click "File->Load from File" to load the HCMV_GFP.gtf file.
4. Click "File->Load from File" to upload bigwig files from the manuscript.
